# No-Com?
I'm getting bored, so; so far develop is being fast, once I have shit to do irl, the upd. will slow down by a lot probably lmfao.

# Patches Situation
Every Client says 1.5.0, I get too lazy to track the patches, I still fix the bugs, I Just dont display the patches, Maybe in the future, currently I dont feel like doing that shit, I fix the bugs before the client even comes out, and if its the recent upd. and has a glitch ill take down the file and re-upload the one with the patch.
